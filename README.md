# alx-higher_level_programming
This is the next step in the alx school that focuses on the higher level programming language 
(Python, Javascript)
This repository contains directories each corresponding to a high-level language project.
These projects are part of the ALX School year 1 curriculum.
In these projects, we cover everything from the basics of Python and Javascript (Node), as well as SQL (with MySQL) to more advanced topics.
